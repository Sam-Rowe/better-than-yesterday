# better-than-yesterday
Working name. 

[A bit of a brain dump of posibilites (also the execution part of the idea)](./Idea.md)

## Challenge
Climate change is bad news. Not enough people are taking action. Those that do take action tend to do so whole sale (not the target audience) or focus on gestures ( swap out plastic straws ). Effect actual change in the majority by being better, small things like the meat free Mondays help. But we need so many of these initatives accross the whole of our lives to achieve real change. 

## Opportunity
Reach people on the fence, or even slightly skeptiacal to make small real impacts. Encorage discourse of positives. Challenge with naratives of positive change without leaving behind the real world.

## Execution
The strategy is to not alienate, but to build a we culture that includes skpetics as well as moderates to actually do something. There are already extemis communities on both sides. Maybe lean on the Extremis of climate action for examples that can be done but highlight practicalities and tone down to make pallitable to all. 

Data must be seen to be indipendent and not from either extremis or will be ignored. 

Qualitative as well as Qunatative inclusive behaviours will need to be gently balanced to engage with a wide enough audience to make real progress.

Global in ambition. 

[See the idea page](./Idea.md) for how we execute. 

## Evolution
One small family in the UK cannot do this all alone. It must be a project with all onboard playing their parts to push the world forwards.
